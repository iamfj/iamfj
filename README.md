If you are reading this page here, you are deep in my digital legacy. Here are my started and never finished ideas and projects waiting to be completed.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm @iamfj and this is my story! I started programming when I was 12 and made my hobby and passion my profession when I was 16. For me it is important to never stand still and to develop daily and learn from others. 

> The lines we write today are the legacy of tomorrow!

We programmers are blessed with a vivid imagination. We have ideas and the tools to implement them quickly. We can quickly create something new first in our minds and then in our code. That's how the world evolves, technology is getting faster and faster. Developers are also getting faster. You can't stand still or you'll be left behind.
