If you are reading this page here, you are deep in my digital legacy. Here are my started and never finished ideas and projects waiting to be completed.

üëã Hi, I'm @iamfj, and this is my story! I started programming when I was 12 and turned my hobby and passion into my profession when I was 16. For me, it's important to keep evolving and learning from others every day.

üìì As programmers, we're blessed with vivid imaginations. We have ideas and tools to bring them to life quickly, and that's how technology evolves at an ever-faster pace. To keep up, we must never stand still but keep improving and pushing ourselves to new heights.

#Ô∏è‚É£ The quote that's stayed with me the longest in my career is:

> The code we write today is the legacy of tomorrow.

This quote reminds me of the responsibility we have as programmers to think carefully about how we write code, knowing that our colleagues will have to work with it long after we're gone.

ü§ù In my professional journey, I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams and take on new challenges. At h.com networkers, I was part of a highly performing team that functioned like clockwork. Despite being a small team, we took on a massive project and pushed it to new heights. We grew so close as a team that my former colleagues are now some of my closest friends.

üí° At SCAILEX, I learned to take responsibility for a product and its people. In a rapidly changing environment that included machine learning models, we created an integration basis for these models within our application landscape. Communication was our biggest challenge, as many stakeholders and teams benefited from our development.

üë®‚Äçüè´ Today, I'm always open to new professional challenges. I want to build high-performing teams that lead to success and be a mentor for others in their own journeys. And with every idea I pursue, whether on my own or with my team, I strive to achieve the best possible outcome.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey!
